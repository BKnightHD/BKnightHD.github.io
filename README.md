# My Data Science Site

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Separate categories are for separate projects.

## About Me

I am a data science enthusiast, currently pursuing a master's in data science. This portfolio showcases my skills and projects in time series analysis, machine learning, financial modeling and more. I aim to demonstrate my capabilities and growth as I work towards a career in finance.
